Work Flow -What I Have Done In This Project
Had used Html,Css,Bootstrap,Reactjs,firebase and Nodejs in this project.
Used Context Api to provide the loaded data through all the page.

In the navbar section,We also see user profile picture and display name when user mouse hover in the picture.

In the second section created cards on the topic of the Course.
When someone click on the Course section user will see course card and side navbar.

We use private router for protect checkout section.When a user logged and register then we can access checout section.

We will also use firebase for authentication.
